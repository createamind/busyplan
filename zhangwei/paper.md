1.VIGAN: Missing View Imputation with Generative Adversarial Networks
https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06724v4

    学习多种传感器数据映射，重建缺失的数据
    
 ```In this paper, we propose a novel approach for view imputation via generative adversarial networks (GANs), which we name as VIGAN. This approach first treats each view as a separate domain and identifies domain-to-domain mappings through GANs using randomly-sampled data from each view, and then employs a multi-modal denoising autoencoder (DAE) to reconstruct the missing view from the GAN outputs based on paired data from each view. Then, by optimizing the GANs and DAE jointly, our model enables the knowledge integration learned for domain mappings and view correspondences to effectively recover the missing view.```
